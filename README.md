# Hawai'i Supernova Flows
The Hawai'i Supernova Flows survey aims to address fundamental questions in cosmology by studying thousands of Type Ia 
supernovae in the local universe, using multi-wavelength observations to map large-scale structures, constrain 
cosmological parameters, and create a valuable dataset for future astronomical research scope.
